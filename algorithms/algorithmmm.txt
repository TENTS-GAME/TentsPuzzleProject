Initially 
1.traverse through the graph and find out cells where tents are adjcent or diagonal(eliminate these cells, it cannot be part of V in bipartite matching)
2.traverse and find out if each of the tents placed are already adjacent to a tree, if yes add an edge between them. Ignore cells already adjacent to another tent.
3.While placing a tent, prune rows/columns that already reached their edge number(Remove cells that cannot be assigned due to row/column limit). if not raeached the edge number, those cells can be a part of the valid cells.
If a row cannot possibly reach its required number, puzzle is impossible.
--Now after all this we'll get a set of valid cells
4.we should sort these cells according to the row column count ie. 
example
Row 2 needs 1 tent , its cell gets highest priority
Row 5 needs 3 tents , cells have lower priority
cells that have fewer conflicts with other trees (i.e fewer neighbors)are prioritized
5.Sometimes, sorting trees by the number of candidate cells is also helpful
Trees with fewer options are matched first








Randomly (or using strategy) choose a valid cell to place a tent.
If no valid cell exists → skip the tree
